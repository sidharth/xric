This was a submission for the [Xerox Research Innovation Challenge](http://xrci.xerox.com/xerox-research-innovation-challenge) hosted by Hackerrank.

It was an ICU dataset with vitals and patient readings, and predictions were to be made on patient fatality. We tried variants of logistic regression, decision trees and SVMs. All code written in R.
